## What is SpotifyQ?
SpotifyQ is a web application powered by React.js that offers a new way to listen to music on Spotify, showing several statistics to appropriately encapsulate your latest relevant listening history. 

## The Technical Details

**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, React.js, Spotify API**

SpotifyQ works by first making API calls to the Spotify RESTful API. It consumes the fetched JSON data that provides your currently playing music as well as access your playlist library. After the listening session is ended by the user, musical statistics specific to that session that were polled in the background are displayed. 

React.js, HTML, and CSS bring it all together to build a front-end UI that the user interacts with to navigate around the SpotifyQ app.
